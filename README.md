# Wildfires, Weather, and Wellbeing: An Analysis of Factors Influencing Air Quality

This project provides an in-depth analysis of the relationship between climate change, wildfire activity, air quality, and public health, specifically focusing on the Alberta region. The Jupyter notebook demonstrates essential data analysis skills, such as data cleaning, preprocessing, and the creation of SQL queries to facilitate visualizations and analysis. Initially, the project imports the necessary libraries and datasets for analysis, followed by detailed data preparation steps, including cleaning and transformation of the raw data.

The analysis makes use of SQL queries to join and filter multiple tables from the dataset, enabling the extraction of relevant information to answer the guiding research questions. The data is carefully cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values and transform it into a suitable format for further analysis. SQL queries are created to merge tables like the wildfire, weather, air pollutants, and health data, ensuring that all necessary variables are available for the visualizations. These visualizations, created using libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly, provide insights into the impacts of weather conditions on wildfire severity and air quality, and how these factors, in turn, affect public health outcomes.

By combining data from different sources, cleaning and structuring it efficiently, and applying SQL queries to organize and filter the data, the notebook offers a comprehensive view of how climate change, wildfire activity, and air pollution are intertwined. It highlights the importance of SQL in manipulating data for analysis and demonstrates the power of data visualization in communicating complex environmental and health issues
